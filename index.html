              In a world where so much comes down to reporting and analytics, business 
              intelligence has become the differentiator—it's all about actions and outcomes, 
              measuring what matters the most, and empowering users with the right insights

              Business intelligence solutions have evolved to keep up with an ever-increasing
               number of data sources, as organizations seek ways to expand their global 
               reach to attract more customers, and give their current customer base access to
                more content, purchasing channels, and brand options. In this context, 
                turning collected data into competitive business knowledge is more important 
                than ever.

                While AI and machine learning keep evolving—and are now used natively by
